      <p>My Dear	█████ ███████,</p>
      <p>
        You propose a most interesting enquiry!
        I must say, in your search of the histories of Goldfolk island, you have come across a providence indeed!
      </p>
      <p>
        In my own personal collection of histories,
        in conjunction with what the Miskatonic can afford paints quite
        the complete picture about the events that unfolded during the
        <strong>1790 and 1860 expeditions to Goldfolk</strong>, and the gruesome finding therein.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you don't mind, but I have already begun to compile my
        notes into this (and the following several) letters.
        Forgive me if this is too forward, but it is too rare for me to find somebody
        with such a direct interest in my work!
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with the 179█ expedition, we struck quite the fortunate circumstance when
        our associates at	███████████████ unearthed the Blackgreave Company's expenses documents,
        as well as their contracts dating back all the way to the 1700's. Hidden amongst the chaff was
        the details of their disastrous attempt to establish their coal mine on Golkfolk island.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with the others, it started innocently enough. A forward group of employee was sent alongside
        some digging equipment via sail. They quickly set upon the first vein, and from their
        reports, they were quite successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have attached a newspaper article snipping that seem relevant.

        <h3>BLACKGREAVE COAL MINING EXPEDITION DEPARTS TO GOLDFOLK ISLAND</h2>
        <time>██/██/179█</time>
        <p>
          Last tuesday, a party of twenty five men hired by the blackgreave company set out on a voyage
          to the distant goldfolk island in hopes of striking the coal vein and restoring
          the blackgreave company to its former glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Company director █████ █████ does not comment when questions as the what this
          means regarding the future of the company, after █████████ stepped down regarding
          his involvement with ████████████ ██████.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
      </article>
      <p>
        We know that Blackgreave was in some financial trouble, so this expedition was seen as
        a bit of a gamble. The miners were instructed to work quickly, and without much thought as
        to safety. When they first discovered the now-infamous <span class="pit" id="pit">goldfolk pit</span>, it was many
        weeks into their efforts. Even before it had fully awoken, it causes no small amount of
        trouble for the workers.
        <img id="spookyImg" width="1000" height="1000" src="https://eyeoncitrus.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/image20.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        The miners reported visions of ██████ █████ near the pit. Rocks that were though to be stable shifted.
        Birds, canaries, that they bought to help detect bad pockets of air squawked unceasingly upon entering the mines, rendering them useless.
        And, interestingly, here we
        see the first instance of the ████████ █████ █████, which the miners claimed to have hauled
        out of the pit (reports on this incident are conflicted even amongst the miners themselves).
      </p>
      <p>
        After the first incidents of █████████ and floodings, Blackgreave realized that if they didn't
        keep a firm grasp on their expedition, they might face bankruptcy. In a very short period
        of time, they assembled a second group of miners, foreman and enforcers to travel to the
        island and get it back on track to meet their deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quite amazingly, the university itself has a copy of the very employment documents of those chosen few on that doomed voyage.
        How fantastical is that! Unfortunately, they are not a complete set,
        but the details and insight they give us into the lives of these unfortunate souls is unparalleled!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah, I am afraid my ink runs dry.
        I have already sent a runner to the campus to request the documents,
        and I shall post you immediately copies of these papers once they enter my possession.
        I am indeed quite grateful to you for the opportunity to indulge in my passions once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to receiving your response! Please let me know if your interest endures beyond my long ramblings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warmest regards, Professor ████████████████.
